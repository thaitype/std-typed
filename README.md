# typed-std

Experimental Implementation of the standard library for the TypeScript, inspired by Rust's standard library.

## Interesting Libraries for Enhancing Standard Library Concepts

  - [immutable-js](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js) e.g. List, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet, and Record.
  - [data-structure-typed](https://github.com/zrwusa/data-structure-typed) - Heap, Binary Tree, Red Black Tree, Linked List, Deque, Trie, HashMap, Directed Graph, Undirected Graph, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Priority Queue, Graph, Queue, Tree Multiset, Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Max Heap, Max Priority Queue, Min Heap, Min Priority Queue, Stack.
